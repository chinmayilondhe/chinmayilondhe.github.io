<h1 class=blog-post__title >GANESH FESTIVAL</h1>
<h2>LOCATION:Pune, Maharashtra </h2>
<h2>DURATION:It falls on the 4th day of the bright fortnight of Bhadrapada (August - September). </h2>

<br><br>
<div class="blog-post__text">
<p><b><em>
This is the most important and biggest festival in Pune. It falls on the 4th day of the bright fortnight of Bhadrapada (August - September). People buy Ganesh images to keep in their houses as a divine guest for five to ten days. The image is then taken out ceremoniously and immersed to the river, sea or well. It is called Visarjan. Keeping the idol after this day is considered inauspicious.</em></b></p>
<br>
<p><b><em> Puja can be simply performed with family members within the household or by a priest. Modak is special cuisine for Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations. Aarti is performed morning and evening (dusk, or at the hour when artificial lamps are lighted in the house) a long as the Ganesh idol is at home.</em></b></p>
<br>
<p><b><em> Huge Ganesh idols are worshipped at nicely decorated pandals, also known as Dekhavas for 8 to 10 days. These Dekhavas are organized by the Mandals, worked collectively for the entire locality. Various Mandals shouting the slogans of Ganpati Bapa Morya take out huge processions during the first day and the day of immersion of the idols throughout the city. People from the city and nearby towns and districts, come in numbers to witness the celebrations of Ganesh festival celebrations. Huge money in terms of crores is spent on decorations of the pandals.</em></b> </p>

<h1 class=blog-post__title >DIWALI PAHAT</h1>
<h2>LOCATION:Pune, Maharashtra </h2>
<h2>DURATION:On the  day of padwa every year.</h2>

<br><br>
<div class="blog-post__text">
<p><b><em>The word Deepotsav is a combination of ‘deep’ meaning lights or diyas and ‘utsav’ meaning a celebration or a festival. For the past 20 years, the municipal corporation of Pune has been organising Deepotsav at Sarasbaug on the day of Padwa . The lawns are lined with thousands of diyas and rangolis drawn with flower petals making the garden look charming than ever! People get all decked up and start coming in from around 3.30 in the morning and the garden gets filled with crowds in no time. It’s always better to get there early, as finding a space to park your bikes is a real task.</em></b></p>
<br>
<p><b><em>Along with the mesmerising views of the thousands of lit up diyas, the sky is also adorned with a bunch of Chinese lanterns. As people come together, the sky is blanketed with gleaming Chinese lanterns swept up by the winds. Don’t have the lanterns? Worry not, the lanterns are sold in the gardens by a few sellers roaming here and there. Another thing to note is that there’s no food or water available inside the garden during this time, but you can always head to the khau galli in the adjacent lane of Sarasbaug for a hearty breakfast once the Deepotsav’s over..</em></b></p>
