                    The fort also overlooks an artificial lake known as the ‘Ganga Sagar Lake’. The only main pathway to the fort passes through the “Maha Darwaja” (Huge Door). The King’s durbar inside the Raigad Fort has a replica of the original throne that faces the main doorway called the Nagarkhana Darwaja. This enclosure had been acoustically designed to aid hearing from the doorway to the throne. The fort has a famous bastion called “Hirakani Buruj” (Hirkani Bastion) constructed over a huge steep cliff.

                <p>The fort has a famous wall called "Hirakani Buruj" (Hirakani Bastion) constructed over a huge steep cliff. The legend goes "that a woman by the name of Hirakani from a nearby village had come to sell milk to the people living at the fort. She happened to be inside the fort when the gates got closed and locked at sunset. Hearing the cries of her infant son back at the village echo after nightfall, the anxious mother couldn't wait till dawn and courageously climbed down the steep cliff in pitch darkness all for the love of her little one. She later repeated this extraordinary feat in front of Shivaji and was bravely rewarded for it." In appreciation of her courage and bravery, Shivaji built the Hirakani Bastion over this cliff.</p>

                <h3>Suvarna Ganesh Temple.</h3>
                <h5>Location: Diveagar, Shrivardhan, Raigad district.</h5>
                <h5>Way to reach: you will get bus facilities from Shrivardhan as well as Alibag. you can also go there by any public tranportation.</h5>
                <h5>Near by attractions: Shrivardhan beach, Harihareshwar beach. </h5>
                <p>Suvarnaganesh Tepmle, Diveagar, is around 75 Km. away from Alibag. History of Suvarnaganesh is quite fascinating. A copper box was found beneath the earth, containing a golden Ganesh Idol and some ornaments belonging to Lord Ganesha, in coconut cultivation area near the temple. Suvarnaganesh is an idol of Lord Ganesha made of gold weighing over 1 Kg. Idol was made approximately 300 to 400 years ago as per local saying.
                </p>
                <p>History of Suvarnaganesha is quite fascinating. It was on the special day of November 17th 1998 (Sankashti Chaturthi as per the Hindu calendar) that there was found a copper box beneath the earth some 40-50 cm. It was weighing 30 kilos,37.5 cm(27 inches) in length,45 cm(18 inches) wide,17.5(7 inches) in height, in a coconut cultivation near the temple.

                    The box was muddy as it was buried and looked ancient. It had some words written from the 10 century in Sanskrit. This incident attracted the entire mob from the Diveagar village. It was to everyone's astonishment as what could be in the box? This was the second incident that an ancient piece of history was found, as earlier there was found a "Tamraptra" at the same place. May be this box could relate something with the "Tamraptra" opening the door of the unsolved mysteries of past..... And the box was opened at 12 noon... There was a sculpture of Lord Ganesh made out of pure gold. Also the box contained ornaments belonging to Lord Ganesha. It was then that the god was named "Suvarnaganesh".
                    
                    Suvarnaganesh is a complete idol of Lord Ganesha,but a sculpture of pure 24 caret gold. Its weighted 1 kilo and 300grams, with height of 60cm(24 inches). The sculpture made is 300 to 400 years ancient. It is said that this sculpture was created to mask some Lord Ganesh stone idol, which was earlier in the temple.</p>

                <h3>Padmadurg Fort</h3>
                <h5>Location: Rajapuri, Murud, Raigad district.</h5>
                <h5>Way to reach: There is Boat facility available from Murud.</h5>
                <h5>Near by attractions: Murud beach, Janjira fort. </h5>
                <P>Padmadurg, also known as Kasa fort, is one of five historical sea forts built by Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and located in Raigad District Maharashtra, India. It was built by Marathas to challenge another seaport Janjira which was controlled by Siddis.
                </P>
                <p>Padmadurg is one of the sea forts built by Maratha King Shivaji in 1676 in order to control the activities in the Arabian sea. It is located in the northwest direction of the Janjira fort at a distance of about 4 km.During cleanup activities in 2012, ASI authorities found around 250 cannonballs of historical value.</p>

                   <p> The sea fort of Padmadurg is not as big as Janjira but still the fort can be visited and enjoyed. Visiting the fort requires taking permission from the Customs/Navy. The fort was not only a part of Sindhudurg's defenses but was also Shivaji main ship construction yard. This fort can also be viewed from Janjira. There was a belt of land from Dandi seashore to Padmadurga but it got blown away under the water in 2004.
                    
                    This fort can be accessed by boats. Boats are mainly available from Murud-Koliwada.</p>

                <h3>Varadvinayak temple.</h3>
                    <h5>Location: Mahad, Raigad district.</h5>
                    <h5>Way to reach: you will get bus facilities from Shrivardhan as well as Alibag. you can also go there by any public tranportation.</h5>
                    <h5>Near by attractions: Shrivardhan beach, Harihareshwar beach. </h5>
                <p>One day, on a hunting trip Rukmaganda stopped at the hermitage of Rishi Vachaknavi. The Rishi's wife, Mukunda, fell in love at the sight of the handsome prince and asked him to fulfill her desires. The virtuous prince flatly refused and left the ashram. Mukunda became very lovesick. Knowing her plight, King Indra took the form of Rukmaganda and made love to her. Mukunda became pregnant and gave birth to a son Gritsamada.

                    
                    
                    Lord Ganesha was pleased by Gritsamada's penance and offered him a boon that he will bear a son who would not be defeated by anybody other than Shankara (Shiva). Gritsamada asks Ganesh to bless the forest, so that any devotees who pray here will be successful, and also urged Ganesha to stay there permanently and asked for knowledge of Brahma. Gritsamada built a temple there and the Ganesha idol installed there is called Varadavinayaka. Today the forest is known as Bhadraka.
                    
                    It is said that if the coconut received as prasad during Maghi Chaturthi is consumed, one will be blessed with a son. Hence the temple is especially full with devotees during Maghi Utsav.</p>
                    <p>The idol of this temple Varada Vinayak is a swayambu (self originated) and was found in the adjoining lake in an immersed position in 1690 AD. This temple is said to be built in 1725AD by Subhedar Ramji Mahadev Biwalkar.[3] The temple premises are on one side of a beautiful pond. The idol of this temple faces the east and has his trunk turned to the left. There is an oil lamp in this shrine which is said to be burning continuously since 1892. This temple also has the idol of Mushika, Navagraha Devatas and Shivalinga. There are 4 elephant idols guarding the 4 sides of the temple. In this Ashta Vinayak Temple devotees can enter the Garbhagriha and pay their homage and respects to the idol personally. Devotees visit the Varadvinayak shrine throughout the year. During festivals like the Magha Chaturthi huge crowds can be seen in this temple.</p>
