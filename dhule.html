                <br>

                <p>Bhamer is well known for its underground caves which are known as Gavali Raja's House. These caves are located in the escarpments of the hills with some are honeycombed, some of them are plain and shapeless, but others are regular buildings with pillar-supported roofs.</p>
                
                <p>Bhamer, however, is known for its fort known after the village name and more so for the caves or rather monk’s dwellings that are in the escarpments of the hills above the village. The fort located at the cast end of a rugged irregular range of rocky hills is divided from the rest of the range by an artificial chasm. The natural escarpment of the fort that overlooks the village has been strengthened in places by masonry constructions. Though the hill is of a considerable height, the ascent is easy and roundabout. On the southern face is the entrance leading into the fort. Inside are several cisterns of good water as also four large store rooms hollowed out of the rock. There are many ruined gateways and gates and nearly ruined towers. Time has also withered away the artificial fortifications at many places. It is supposed that the town was destroyed while punishing Kale Khan, a Muslim rebel, who had seized it in 1736. It never regained its original glory.
 
                </p>
                
                <p>At distance of 48 kilometers from Dhule city  and 13 kilometers from Sakri the fort of Bhamer is situated. There is a famous place of pilgrimage of Jain devotees at a distance of 27 kilometers from this fort. Here too, many Jain devotees from all over the country come to visit. In this temple Lord Vimalnath has a black stone statue.</p>

At the foot of this fort which lies at the summit of a small hill, lies an ancient and prehistoric stone temple dedicated to the deity Thaleshwar after whom the city of Thalner and its main military fort, take name. Thalner is a scenic location on the banks of the Tapi River, the fort built on an elevation to overlook the riverfront from a height. It was the stronghold of Faruqi kings and once a significant hub of trade and commerce during the peak of its glory.
                    
                    
                    </p>
                <p>The Thalner fort was a brilliant piece of architectural and shrewd military marvel. While it was surrounded by a hollow embanked moat on 3 sides, the fort wall rose from the Tapi River, thereby giving inhabitants safety from attack on 3 sides and the river always open for emergency exit. The only entrance is made available on the eastern side after traversing 5 gates all held together by a genius mechanism whose enclosure would rise up to the height of the main wall.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Thalner fort is open all days, yet tourist are advised to visit there in daylight time due to the difficult terrain.
