                        Huge processions are taken out on the streets that carry sculptures depicting evil forces. At the end of the festival, the effigies are burnt and assumed that all evil forces will die along with it. The people of Nagpur celebrate Marbat by praying to the Almighty to grant them optimism in every aspect of life, by indulging in some retail therapy and devouring on mouth-watering food.

                        After the procession, which goes on for several kms, the yellow and black statues meet at Nehru Putla Square before they are put on fire. People also celebrate this meeting of statues as they dance and shower flower petals on the statues. The statues at the celebrations are made by Shende family, which has been making them for three generations now. Ganpatrao Shende, after whom his son Bhimaji Shende took over, prepared the statues in 1885.

During the celebration, people gather to address various social problems. Few locals, speaking about the occasion, once told ANI, “Kali and Pivli are believed to be sisters who are made to meet each other on this day. While some believe that the festival has some historical value others consider Kali and Pivli as deities. Locals raise a famous slogan during this festival ‘Rograi gheun ja ge marbat,’ which means ‘rid us of diseases.’ A lot of people believe that the Kali and Pilvi marbat will make their wishes come true during this festival. It also related to history during the British Raj.”
