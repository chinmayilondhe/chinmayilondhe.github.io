                        Gudi Padwa is an Indian festival that marks the beginning of the New Year and the harvest season for the people of Maharashtra. Gudi is the word used to refer to Brahma’s flag (which is hoisted on this day) while Padva is derived from the Sanskrit word Paddava or Paddavo which refers to the first day of the bright phase of the moon. This festival is celebrated on the first day of the month of Chaitra, according to the Hindu calendar, which usually falls during March-April according to the Gregorian calendar. This day is also symbolic of the season of Vasant or spring in India. Besides Maharashtra, it is also observed under different names in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu as well, however by a smaller community of people.

                        One of the sacred texts of the Hindus, the Brahma Purana states that Lord Brahma recreated the world after a raging deluge in which all time had stopped and all the people of the world, destroyed. On Gudi Padva, time restarted and from this day on, the era of truth and justice (known as Satyug) began. Therefore, Lord Brahma is worshipped on this day.

                            Another popular legend about the origin of this festival revolves around the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya along with his wife Sita and his brother Laxman from exile. The ‘Brahmadhvaj’ or ‘the flag of Brahma’ (other names for the Gudi) is hoisted in memory of the coronation of Lord Rama. The Gudi is hoisted at the entrance of the household in commemoration of the Gudi that was hoisted in Ayodhya as a victory flag. It is also believed that Lord Rama was victorious over King Bali on this day, marking this occasion.

                        Shri Rama was born in the Suryavanshi Ikshavaku Dynasty family; born to King Dasharatha and his first Queen Kaushalya in the Treta Yuga. He was known worldwide as Raja Ram by his subjects in the Kingdom. He is also known to be the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Chaitra Navratri is marked to celebrate Goddess Durga and the triumph of good over evil. The ninth-day culminates with Ram Navami and quite significantly, both the festivals denote the victory of good over evil spirits.

                        As mentioned earlier, Ram Navami commemorates the birth anniversary of Lord Rama and so, Hindus across the country and in different parts of the world chant stories about Shri Ram. Many recite and sing folklores to celebrate the festival. Worshippers also wash Lord Ram’s idols and decorate them with dresses and make the statue sit in a miniature cradle. Other devotees even organise community meals for the neighbourhood, especially to be distributed among the poor. Other people also observe a vrat (fast) at this festival. People offer sweets to one another to mark this special occasion.
