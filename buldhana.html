The place where Jijau played the color is the palace of the palace. In this Mahal, the marriage of ShahajiRaje and Jijau was discussed.</p>
                
                <p>Here is the ancient temple of Nilkanteshwar, the inscription inscribed by the King Lakhujirao Jadhav for the revival of the temple. In front of this temple there is a massive bar arranged by stairs to the bottom of the square. The Hemadpanthi Rameshwar Temple is in the 8th to the 10th century.
                    A beautiful example of the formation of the great forts during the tenure of Rajerao Jagadevrao Jadhav was that of Kalkoth. The timeless walls of this superb and strong, are 20 feet wide and the same height. In addition to this, there is a 40-foot-tall walled fort called Sachkarwada, which can be seen on an intersection, there are internal roads, well inside, wells, sub-basement and subway. So the entrance of this object is also very beautiful.</p>
