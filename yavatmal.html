                <h3>Tipeshwar wild life sanctuary </h3>
                <br>
                <h5>Location: The sanctuary is situated at Pandarkawada Tehsil, in the district of Yavatmal, Maharashtra.</h5>
                <h5>Way to reach:public transport option: buses, taxis and auto will reach you here from any point in the city.</h5>
                <h5>Near by attractions: Sunna Gate, Tipeshwar Wild Life Sanctuary.</h5>
                <p>The safety aspect of tigers in Tipeshwar is all the more important as any infection could prove disastrous owing to the density of their population. The Sanctuary, spread over just 143 sq km of dry deciduous forest, is home to about 20 tigers of different ages and sizes and infection could spread comparatively faster.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Tipeshwar is closely linked to tiger conservation in Kawal Tiger Reserve (KTR) in former united Adilabad district in Telangana as the overflowing population in the former crosses over to the latter ambling through the corridor which links the two. A tigress which had crossed Penganga river demarcating the border between the two States and entered Bheempur forests, apparently headed towards KTR a couple of months ago is now back in the sanctuary in Maharashtra, according to sources.
                   </p>
                <br>
                <p>“We were alert about the safety of the tigers even before reports of coronavirus infection started appearing in the media. The Sanctuary is in a state of complete lockdown now,” asserted Pandharkawda Divisional Forest Officer, Wildlife, Subhash Puranik.</p>

                <h5>Near by attraction: :  Chintamani Ganga Aqua.</h5>
                <p>One of the Ashtaganesh (8 Ganpati Temples), of Vidarbha, the Chintamani Ganpati, at Kalamb, is unique in that the temple is underground (around 27-30 feet). It is one of the 21 Kshetras of Ganpati in Maharashtra and is considered to have been constructed in the 7th or 8th Century.
                    Located on the banks of the River Chakravarti, it is said to have been the site where Lord Ganesh blessed Lord Indra, who prayed to Him to get relieved of the curse of Rishi Gautam.
                <p>Kalamb Ganesh Mandir finds reference in the Ganesh Puran as well as the Skanda and Mudgal Puranas.
                    Once in 12 years, in the Hindu month of Ashwin (Sept-Oct), the water from the Ganesh Kund in front of the idol, begins to rise and partially submerges the idol as per the locals.</p>
                <p>Temple is well-maintained and requires one to climb down medium height steps to reach the sanctum-sanctorum (Garbagruha). One is blessed with the darshan of a 4.5 feet high Ganesha idol.
                    Another unique and uncommon feature of the temple is that the idol is dakshinabhimukh, i.e. facing south!
                    The place has a very spiritual feel. The place is not very crowded except on Special Days and the annual festival during Ganesh Chaturthi.
                    It is located at Kalamb Village, about 20-22 km from Yavatmal city. The road is motor able right upto the temple parking.
                    Jai Ganesh!</p>
