                <h3>Hazur Sahib</h3>
                <h5>Timing:any time</h5>
                <h5>Entry fee:none</h5>
                <h5>Location:Gurudwara Road, Yatri Niwas Rd, Sharda Nagar, Hyder Bagh, Nanded, Maharashtra 431601</h5>
                <p>Hazur Sahib (Hazūrī Sāhib; lit. 'presence of the sahib/master'), also known as Takht Sachkhand Sri Hazur Abchalnagar Sahib, is one of the five takhts in Sikhism. It is located on the banks of the Godavari River at the city of Nanded in the state of Maharashtra, India. The gurdwara within the complex is known as Sach-Khand (Realm of Truth).[1]
                    The structure is built at the place where Guru Gobind Singh left his earthly life. The inner room of the gurdwara is called the Angitha Sahib and is built over the place where Guru Gobind Singh was cremated in 1708. The gurdwara was built between 1832 and 1837 by order of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780–1839). Hazur Sahib marks the site where Guru Gobind Singh had his camp in 1708. The Guru held his court and congregation here and was convalescing after being attacked by two would-be assassins. One of the attackers stabbed the Guru, and was killed by him with a single stroke of his talwar (curved sword). The other was killed by his followers as he tried to escape. The Guru's wound was deep, but initially healed after being stitched by an English surgeon sent by Bahadur Shah I, who served as his doctor, and Dara Shikoh before him.[2] However the wound re-opened a few days later when the Guru was stringing a bow for one of his Sikhs and the Guru merged into the Primal (Joti Jot) after declaring the Guru Granth Sahib as his successorThe Sikhs built a room over the platform where Guru Gobind Singh would sit while holding his court and installed the Guru Granth Sahib on it. They called it Takhat Sahib. Guru Gobind Singh, while conferring Guruship on the holy Book, had himself named Nanded as "Abchalnagar" (literally "Steadfast city") after the first word of a hymn read at random on the occasion.
                    In October 2008, the 300th-anniversary celebration of the Guruship of Guru Granth Sahib took place here. This site is now one of five Takhats which are places of primary importance to the Sikhs. The other four takhats are: Akal Takhat at Amritsar, Takhat Keshgarh Sahib at Anandpur, Takhat Patna Sahib in Bihar and Takhat Damdama Sahib in Talwandi Sabo, Bhatinda, Punjab

                <h5>Location:Mahurgad, Maharashtra 431721</h5>
                <p>Mahur or Mahurgad is a town and religious place in Nanded district of Maharashtra, India.[1] Mahur is the birthplace of Hindu God Dattatreya.[2] Dattatreya parents Atri Rishi and Sati Anasuya Mata lived here. Brahmadev, Vishnudev and Lord Shiva once got a news about Anusaya Mata that there is no one more pious and pure as her. To test her piousness they arrived under the garb of asking Alm (bhiksha).
                    There are three mountains in Mahur. The first one and most known is having Renuka Mata Temple, who is mother of the god Parshuram. Other two are called Datta Shikhar and Atri Anasuya Shikar Temple's. Mahur has a sacred temple to Renuka Mata, which is considered one of the three and half Shakti Peethas (temples) in the state. A big fair is held here every year on the occasion of Vijayadashami.[citation needed]
                    Sahasrarjun attacked Renuka Devi while somewhere in today's Telangana, for he wanted to grab the sacred Kamdhenu cow — this cow has the divine power to fulfill wishes. When Renuka Mata refused to him that saying asking gift of your own choice by the guest visitor is uncalled. He attacked her & injured her. She dies in this & when Lord Parshuram knew about it, he went berserk. Then the elderly people pacified him & asked him to do the last rites in Mahur under Dattatreya's guidance. Then he was told by him that Renuka Mata will appear on first mountain for you to worship. This became the famous Renuka Mata temple. The "Matru Tirth" (means sacred place for Mother's worship) Place on this Mountain is the one which is where today stands a lake, is "Antyeshti Sthan" (Means place where last rites were performed).[citation needed]
                    There are many other temples in Mahur like Rishi Jamdagni Temple, Lord Parshuram Temple, Kalika Mata Temple, Devdevshwar Temple, and also the Caves called Pandav Leni.

                    Sahasrakund Waterfall
                    सहस्रकुंड धबधबा
                    
                    
                    Sahasrakund situated at a distance 172 km from Yavatmal and 100 km from Nanded . It is also 50 km from Nirmal and 100 km from Adilabad and 50 km from umarkhed.
                    It is considered as important tourist attraction in rainy season. Waterfall is also known for its rock pattern which looks like black metal.
                    The Sahastrakund waterfall is on the Banganga River in Murli village. The village Murli is located in the Nanded District of Maharashtra State, India. The waterfalls will be available round the year, as river Banganga makes from four to five places only to meet the Holy Godavari River. The Rock Pattern here is equally interesting, as the black rock appears like a metal. But be careful, you should not come too close, because you are sure to get wet if you do. Remember, the water does come down with a lot of speed. The Banganga River is wide too at this place, and this is what makes the Sahastrakund waterfall appear so impressive.

                <p>The Siddheshwar temple is a famous Hindu pilgrimage center located in Hottal, Degloor. The place is situated 105 kms away from Nanded city.

                    Siddheshwar temple is believed to be from the Kalyani-Chalukya era. The temple is beautifully ornate with stone carvings and sculptures of Hindu idols and gods. The temple is built in the Hemadpanti style of architecture. The ancient name of Hottal was Pottal. The temple was built by Dev who was a Tehsil Officer during the Chalukya era. In the ancient times, Hottal was the capital of the Someshwar Chalukyas and as a result many monuments from this era is present in Hottal. The basic shape of the temple is a star, this is assumed to be a relation with the Hemadpanti architecture. Almost all the walls of the temple is decorated with many idols mainly shiv tandav, nritya ganesh, and goddesses. It is believed that the temple was built in 11th or 12th century. There is an inscription on the wall of this temple, which is believed to be of Raja Vikramaditya from 1120 AD. The monument was acquired by the archeology department in the year 1960.
                    
                    The Siddheshwar temple is one of the very popular destinations for religious pilgrimage. The believers say that the deity is very powerful and is one of the very rare. This temple also known as the golden temple due to the heavy ornamentation of its walls and pillars. The temple is not simply a monument but rather, an architectural wonder. It is one of those places where the creations of a dynasty have stood the tests of time. The temple is a rare specimen of this kind of architecture. The sculpture of the deity is carefully and oranately carved. The linga is carved with at most care and the craftsmanship is very well shown. The main idol is shiva and he is in 'nishchalabhaava' which means unmoved. The other deities includes goddess Laxmi and Ganesh. The temple was restore recently by the archeological department and many of the sculptures were nearly eroded and now all of it have been returned to its former glory.
