Thane city is entirely within Thane taluka, one of the seven talukas of Thane district; also, it is the headquarters of the namesake district. With a population of 1,841,488 distributed over a land area of about 147 square kilometres (57 sq mi), Thane city is the 15th most populated city in India with a population of 1,890,000 according to the 2011 census.[1]

            Located on the north-western side of the state of Maharashtra, the city is an immediate neighbour of Mumbai city and a part of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">

                Thane is well connected to other regions by an extensive network of Railways and Roadways - including one national highway passing through Thane. As Thane is next to Mulund (which is the last station of Mumbai's Eastern Suburb), Airoli (which is the first station of Navi Mumbai's North-Western suburb), Bhiwandi the Junction to (2 Twin cities) of Kalyan- Dombivali & Vasai -Virar, and the Borivali Mumbai's Western Suburb & Mira Road/Bhayander through Ghodbunder Road, most parts of the city are easily accessible.

                Railways
                Thane was the terminus for the first ever passenger train in Asia. On 16 April 1853, the passenger train service was inaugurated between Bori Bunder (Mumbai) and Thane.[9] Covering a distance of 34 km (21 mi), it was hauled by three locomotives: Sahib, Sindh and Sultan.
                
                Thane is connected with neighbouring suburbs through Central and Trans-Harbour Line Suburban railway network. Thane is a railway junction for the Thane-Vashi & Panvel Harbour Line and Central Line. It is one of the busiest stations in India and handles 654,000 passengers daily.[10][11]
                
                Metro
                As of 2019, Wadala and Thane are being connected through a Metro line.[12]
                
                On 26 August 2015, MMRDA sanctioned ₹354 billion for 118 km Mumbai metro network. This includes a 40-km Wadala-Ghatkopar-Thane-Kasarvadavali Metro-4 corridor via Wadala GPO and R.A.Kidwai Marg costing ₹120 billion.[13]
                
                As of January 2021, the MMRDA, the nodal agency for building 300 km of vast Metro network, has proposed a plan to build an elevated depot for three Metro lines : 4 (Wadala-Thane-Kasarvadavali), 4A (Kasarvadavali-Gaimukh), 10 (Gaimukh-Shivaji Nagar) and 11 (Wadala-General Post Office, CSMT) at one stop. This depot is proposed at Mogharpada, Thane. The total project cost is estimated to be ₹ 596.60 crore.</span> </p>

                <p>Bhuikot Killa means a fort that is built on flat land and not on any mountain. Bhui means Land in Marathi and Kot means Killa or Fort. Most forts during the Shivaji Maharaj's era were built atop mountains. However, certain forts were also built on flat land (not necessarily by Shivaji). A good example is Devagiri, This is now not Remained as a Fort its now residential place for JAHAGIRDAR Family. (Daulatabad) Fort in Aurangabad district, Maharashtra.
                    We love history, it allows us a small glimpse into a life with moments and events that have been instrumental in shaping the future and the present. Maharashtra comes with her own glorious past and history and is dotted with many such places that will allow you to relive these yesteryears. While Pratapgad, Raigad, Sinhgad, Sindhudurg are all the popular forts in Maharashtra boasting of the legacy of Chhatrapati Shivaji, Solapur is home to one very unique fort. If you’re heading to Solapur, then you need to drop everything and go visit Bhuikot Killa or Fort. This major tourist attraction was built in the 14th Century by the Bahmani Dynasty. History states that Aurangzeb also spent quite some time at this fort until it was won and handed over to the Peshwas.

                <h5>Best Season to visit:You can visit any time</h5>
                <p>Vajreshwari village in Bhiwandi taluka of Thane district is one of the important places of religious places in Maharashtra due to the healthy hot water ponds. This place is situated on the banks of Tansa river and the Samadhi of Srinithanand Maharaj is situated here. The Vajreshwari Devi temple built by Chimaji App is also famous. Hot water springs in Akloli and Ganeshpuri are the main attraction for tourists. These fountains are believed to contain hot water with medicinal properties.The original temple of Vajreshwari was at Gunj, five miles (8 km) north of Vadavli. It was moved to Vadvali after its destruction by the Portuguese.[1]

                    In 1739, Chimaji Appa - the younger brother and military commander of Peshwa Baji Rao I - had set up camp in the Vadvali region on his way to capture the Portuguese-held Bassein Fort of Vasai. The fort was unconquerable even after a three-year war. Chimaji Appa prayed to goddess Vajreshwari that if he could conquer the fort and defeat the Portuguese, he would build a temple to her. According to legend, the goddess Vajreshwari appeared in his dream and told him how to conquer the fort. On 16 May, the fort fell and the defeat of the Portuguese in Vasai was complete. To celebrate his victory and to fulfill the vow taken in front of the goddess Vajreshwari, Chimnaji Appa ordered the new Subhedar (governor), Shankar Keshav Phadke, to build the Vajreshwari temple.
                    
                    The Nagarkhana in the main entrance gate was built by the Gaikwads, Maratha dynasty of Baroda. The stone steps leading to the temple and the Dipamala (a tower of lights) in front of the temple were built by Nanasaheb Chandavadakar, a moneylender from Nashik.</p>
