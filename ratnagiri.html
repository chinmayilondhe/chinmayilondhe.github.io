            In 1886, King Thibaw of Burma was sent to Ratnagiri after he was deposed and his country annexed by the British Empire. Along with his pregnant wife, his junior queen, and his two young daughters, he would live out the rest of his life in Ratnagiri, as a prisoner of the British Crown. Ratnagiri was chosen for its remote location, some 3,000 miles from Thibaw's former royal seat of Mandalay, accessible only by sea for parts of the year and far from any territory of any rival European power.</span> </p>

King Shivaji had built protecting towers on two commanding points, one at the south and the other near the old court house. The Citadel defense was improved by maratha Koli admiral Kanhoji Angre in 1750–1755. Dhondu Bhaskar Pratinidhi did some minor repairs to the fort during Peshwa regime (1755–1818). The fort was later won by the British in 1818. The temple of Bhagavati was renovated in 1950.</p>
                <p>The nearest town is Ratnagiri. The fort is at walkable distance from the town. A wide road leads to the entrance gate of the fort. It takes about an hour to have a walk around the fort.</p>
