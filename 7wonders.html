                    Raigad is a hill fort situated at about 25 Km from Mahad in the Raigad district. Chhatrapati Shivaji renovated this
                    fort and made it his capital in 1674 AD. The rope-way facility is available at Raigad Fort, to reach at the fort
                    from ground in few minutes.
                </em></b></p>
                  <br>
                  <p><b><em> The fort also overlooks an artificial lake known as the ‘Ganga Sagar Lake’. The only main pathway to the fort passes through the 
                    “Maha Darwaja” (Huge Door). The King’s durbar inside the Raigad Fort has a replica of the original throne that faces the main 
                     doorway called the Nagarkhana Darwaja. This enclosure had been acoustically designed to aid hearing from the doorway to the throne. 
                     The fort has a famous bastion called “Hirakani Buruj” (Hirkani Bastion) constructed over a huge steep cliff.

                        One needs to climb 1,737 steps to reach this hill fort, which is surrounded by lush greenery and picturesque views.
                         To get a sweeping view of the area, you can take the Raigad ropeway that takes about 10 minutes to reach the fort. 
                        For those with an adventurous side, trekking is the best option.

                    the Fortress City. The scenic island stretches across 10 to 15 sq km of land and has a dense foliage of mango, tamarind and palm

                         who came to this area. The island owes its global popularity to the fact that it is home to a network of ancient rock-cut caves
                          known as the Elephanta caves that boast artistic wall carvings and sculptures, dedicated to Hindu and Buddhist gods. 
                          These caves were incorporated in the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites in the early 1980s. The walls of the caves, 
                          which are located on top of a hillock, are lined with rock art that experts say,dates as far back as the mid- 5th and 6th century.

                            perched on it and the latter because of the remains of a Buddhist stupa that was excavated here. 
                            The most intricately detailed and architecturally majestic cave, among the Elephanta network is situated on Gun Hill.
                             The panels on these caves depict the lives and beliefs of the esoteric Pashupati sect of the Shaiva system.

                             residential cells. Caves 9 and 10 are chaityas, which contain the earliest known remnants of paintings in India. Caves 19, 26 
                             and 29 are chaityas of the Mahayana period and all the other caves are viharas.

                                 Gupta period; and the Amaravati school of art from the late Satavahana and Ikshvaku periods. The Ajanta paintings recount 
                                 the life of Lord Buddha, including his previous earthly experiences and the Jataka tales. The caves are divided into two
                                  chronological phases, the early Buddhist caves (2nd century BCE to 1st century CE) and the Mahayana caves (5th century CE). 
                                 Since Ajanta is located on the ancient trade route of Dakshinapatha, the early phase of Ajanta was funded mostly by traders.

                                which includes the Tadoba National Park, created in the year 1955. The Andhari Wildlife Sanctuary was formed in the year 1986
                                 and was amalgamated with the park in 1995 to establish the present Tadoba Andheri Tiger Reserve. The word 'Tadoba' is derived
                                  from the name of God "Tadoba" or "Taru," which is praised by local tribal people of this region and "Andhari" is derived from the name of Andhari river that flows in this area.
