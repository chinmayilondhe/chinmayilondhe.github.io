          <h3>Daulatabad Trek</h3>
          <p>Located 15 km away from the main city of Aurangabad, Daulatabad Fort is an ancient fortification that rises formidably from the midst of verdant greenery. Often hailed as one of the 'seven wonders of Maharashtra', this architectural marvel is believed to have been built in the 12th century. Also known as Devgiri fort, perhaps the most enchanting qualities is its location, from the zenith of which you can capture a mesmerising view of the entire city. You need to hike some 750 odd steps up to the top, but the view down below is a wonderful thing to behold.</p>

            <p>One of the most inspiring aspects of the Daulatabad Fort is its design which makes it one of the most powerful fortresses of the medieval period.

Another unique aspect of the mighty Devgiri Fort is its engineering genius, which not only provided an impregnable defence against enemy forces but also managed irreplaceable resources of water quite well. The contrast of the ancient edifice against the lush green fields of Aurangabad paints a wonderful picture that takes you back through the pages of the days bygone.</p>

          <h3>Ausa fort Trek</h3>
          <p>Ausa fort in Latur district is one such fort that has a blurred history of itself. Ausa Fort’s prominence came to light during the fights between the Deccan Sultanates after the Bahamani Era. The Fort had been named 13 different names, but the name Ausa was the last one that it is now known by. The fort is located in a depressed ground level, and the highest point of the fort looks over the surrounding higher ground level. The design seems to have been useful to watch out for incoming armies from a greater distance while keeping most of the fort hidden.</p>

           <p> The Fort is designed in a nearly square form with a double rampart mounted with Turkish engineered cannons over semicircular bases, and the whole fort is in the centre with almost 120 feet wide ditches surrounding it. The Fort has seen numerous modifications from its original form thus unintendedly becoming a design collaboration of the Hindu and Muslim architecture over the years of its occupancy. Among the surviving Inscriptions that are mostly in an unreadable condition, one of the Nilgiri inscription dates to the year 1529. The Ausa Fort happens to have a patchy History that needs discovery.</p>
