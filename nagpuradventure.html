          <h3>Manikgad Trek</h3>
          <p>Manikgad(also called Gadchandur) is an ancient fort in Chandrapur district, Maharashtra. It is a hill fort 507 metres above sea level built by the Naga kings in the 9 CE. Currently the forts is in a state of ruins and is frequently by wild animals that live in the vicinity like panthers and boars. Several monuments of historical importance are also present in the area.</p>

            <p>Manikgad was built by the last Mana Naga King - Gahilu. The Mana Nagas settled in this area around 9 CE. Initially, the fort was named Manikagad after the patron deity of the Mana Nagas - Manikadevi - but later on this got shortened to Manikgad. The fort is built of large black stones and it would have been a formidable fort in its time. Rampart walls of the fort enclose a valley which has ruins of old buildings and store-houses. Outlines of some apartments are visible against the rampart walls. The southern bastion along with its supporting wall has collapsed. In the valley below lies a cannon which likely was mounted on that bastion. Unlike a cast iron cannon, this cannon made of several iron straps welded together. The gateway of the fort is still intact.</p>
