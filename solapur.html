                <p>Siddheshwar Temple is a temple in Solapur district, Maharashtra, India.[1][2][3] It is sacred to Hindus and members of the Lingayat faith.[4] There is a lake within the temple complex.
                    Located amidst a lake further flanked by Bhuikot fort, Siddheshwar temple is sacred to Lord Siddheshwar, who is considered as an incarnation of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. The temple is highly revered by the devotees as it is the place where Shri Siddheshwar attained Samadhi. In the main temple complex, there is a beautiful sanctum, which features the idol of Siddheshwar. Also in the main courtyard, there are 68 shiva lingams, which were installed by Lord Siddheshwar. Amrit Linga and Lord Ganesha temples are special mentions. Silver-plated Nandi, and the temple of Vithoba and Goddes Rukmini along with the various other gods are a part of the temple. In the middle of the temple, there is a marble tomb of Siddheshwar. All devotees here are offered maha-prasad.
                    As per the records, Siddheshwar temple was built by a yogi, and a devotee of Shri Mallikarjuna of Srisailam, Shri Siddharameshwar. He built this temple and made 68 Shiva lingams in the temple as per the instructions of his guru. It is said that Shri Siddheshwar, who is also considered as the six prophets of Lingayat religion, believed that birth of this saint caused the prosperity of the city and the deity is capable of blessing the devotees.
                    The temple and lake have been administered since 1899 by the ‘Shri Siddheshwar Devsthan Panch Committee’.

                <h5>Location: Bhuikot Killa (Old Fort), Solapur, Killa Road, Sidheshwar Temple Area, Solapur, Solapur, Maharashtra,</h5>

                <p>Bhuikot Killa means a fort that is built on flat land and not on any mountain. Bhui means Land in Marathi and Kot means Killa or Fort. Most forts during the Shivaji Maharaj's era were built atop mountains. However, certain forts were also built on flat land (not necessarily by Shivaji). A good example is Devagiri, This is now not Remained as a Fort its now residential place for JAHAGIRDAR Family. (Daulatabad) Fort in Aurangabad district, Maharashtra.
                    We love history, it allows us a small glimpse into a life with moments and events that have been instrumental in shaping the future and the present. Maharashtra comes with her own glorious past and history and is dotted with many such places that will allow you to relive these yesteryears. While Pratapgad, Raigad, Sinhgad, Sindhudurg are all the popular forts in Maharashtra boasting of the legacy of Chhatrapati Shivaji, Solapur is home to one very unique fort. If you’re heading to Solapur, then you need to drop everything and go visit Bhuikot Killa or Fort. This major tourist attraction was built in the 14th Century by the Bahmani Dynasty. History states that Aurangzeb also spent quite some time at this fort until it was won and handed over to the Peshwas.

                <p> Rukmini Mandir (Marathi: श्री विठ्ठल-रूक्मिणी मंदिर, Kannada: ಶ್ರೀ ವಿಠ್ಠಲ - ರುಕ್ಮಿಣೀ ಮಂದಿರ is a Hindu temple in Pandharpur in the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is the main centre of worship for Vithoba, a form of the god Vishnu or Krishna, and his consort Rakhumai. It is the most visited temple in Maharashtra. The Warkaris start marching from their homes to the temple of Pandharpur in groups called Dindi (procession) to reach on Aashadhi Ekadashi and Kartiki Ekadashi. A dip in the holy river Chandrabhaga, on whose banks Pandharpur resides, is believed to have power to wash all sins. All the devotees are allowed to touch the feet of the idol of Vithoba. In May 2014, the temple became the first in India to invite women and people from backward classes as priests.[1][2][3][4][5]

                    Although parts of the temple date to the 12th or 13th centuries, the existing structure mainly dates to the 17th century or later, and reflects the later Deccan style, with dome motifs and lobed arches.[6]</p>

                <p>It's not only the temples, and the forts that make a mark on the list of attractions in Solapur. The city too has many wonderful places that have a strong connect with nature. And one such place is the Moti Baug tank. Located in the heart of the city, Moti Baug Lake is a prominent bird watching attraction in Solapur. It is commonly known as the Kambar Talao Lake. Along with the migratory birds, the lake is also known for its pretty pink and white lotuses often seen floating on its bed. On a visit to the lake, tourists can choose to either relax or indulge in bird watching tour.

                    GETTING THERE
                    The Moti Baug is one kilometer away from the bus stand. From the bus stand, one can take an auto rickshaw, tongas and six seaters.
