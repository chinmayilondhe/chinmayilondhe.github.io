          <h3>Trek To Kalsubai In Igatpuri</h3>
         <p>If you are fit and love to trek around on beautiful treks, then this is a must-to-do list when you are in Nashik. Kalsubai is in the Western Ghats at a height of 5400 feet above sea level. This is a moderate level trek and is meant for fit people, not necessarily you have done a trek before. To start, you can reach the hanuman mandir that is a few kilometers away from Bari town. The best time to visit this Kalsubai peak is all year around. You can experience monsoon trek from June up till August, then you can see bloom trek from September until October. November up till May, people prefer going on a night trek. Monsoon trek to this place is quite commendable with nice weather. On your way to Kalsubai, you will witness various beautiful landscapes full of gleaming water and pristine ranges of Western Ghats.</p>
         <p>Kalsubai is a 6.6 km-long (4.1 mi) trek with an elevation gain of around 2,700 feet (820 m). This is a one-day trek having a moderately hard difficulty level, with lush green landscapes and multiple waterfalls. The peak attracts many trekkers and devotees determined to scale the mountain. To reach the summit there are well-designated trekking routes. The most popular route is through the eastern mountain face taking off from the base village Bari. The Waki river, a tributary of Pravara, takes origin on its eastern slope and flows like a stream through the outer fringes of Bari. A short distance away from the stream a Hanuman temple has been built. This provides an important landmark to commence the trek as well as a resting post for those nearing the final lap of their trek. The route from behind this temple takes the hiker straight to the summit. The trek along this route is a mix of easy to ascend slopes as well as treacherous rocky outcrops overlooking the valley below. Considering the increasing footfall in recent years, the government has built iron ladders along the vertical hill slopes. These assist trekkers to allow for a convenient and safe ascent.</p>

           <p> The route via Indore is relatively unexplored as not many people are aware of it. Unlike the regular route via Bari, which has fixed ladders, cemented steps and several people flocking during the monsoon, the route via Indore is raw with stone steps and a huge iron chain for support at the dangerous patches.</p>

          <h3>3 Forts trekking</h3>
         <p> Alang, Kulang, and Madan are three forts located in western Ghats near Nashik. It is one of the most difficult treks available in that area. You need to cross through a dense forest to reach these forts. Also, the path of the trek is not clear and there are chances of you getting lost in the jungle. Especially during monsoons, the paths could get confusing as all the man-made marks get washed away with rainwater. Again, the trek to Kulang fort is made difficult due to huge rocks in the path which are difficult and tiring to climb on. Also, the trek is long and takes around six to eight hours to reach the pinnacle.</p>

         <p>While you trek to Madan fort is a bit smaller and takes only around 4 hours, but you might have to do a bit of rock climbing to reach the peak of the fort. You must carry your food and water with you which can be refilled from the water cisterns you encounter on the top of the forts. People travelling here often plan a three-day trip to cover all three treks at once. However, due to the high difficulty level, please measure your stamina and then plan your trek.</p>
