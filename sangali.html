                <br>
                <h5>Location: Kala Nagar, Sangli, Maharashtra 416416</h5><br>
                <h5>Way to reach:Nearest Railway Stations are Sangli (57 km) and Miraj Junction (64 km).</h5>
               
                <p>Audumbar is known for the shrine of Dattatraya held in high reverence. It is said to have been built in honour of Nar-sirhha Sarasvati who was a great saint and who is supposed to be the incarnation of Dattatraya. His greatness has been extolled in Guru Charitra written by Sarasvati Gangadhar. Narsimha was born of a poor Brahman couple, Madhava and Amba, in about 1304.

                    After his thread ceremony he left on a holy pilgrimage and on its completion came to Audumbar on the banks of the Krushna to engross himself secretly in religious mortification during the Caturmasa. At this time it so happened that a Brahman’s son who was dull−witted, overcome with shame at the remarks passed by the people in this regard, went to Bhuvanesvari temple on the opposite bank of the Krushna and prayed for three days and nights without taking any food. But the goddess remained unmoved by his severe penance upon which he cut off his tongue and laid it at Her feet. Taking pity the goddess advised him to go to Audumbar and pray Narsirhha. The boy taking the command went to Narsirhha and falling at his feet received the blessings of the sage. The identity of the saint having been known, thousands of people began to flock to the place for darshan.
                    
                    At the end of Chaturmasa, when the sage prepared to leave, the people requested him to stay. He only left his padukas under audumbar tree over which a small shrine was erected by a devotee from Poona who also built a dharmashala.</p>
