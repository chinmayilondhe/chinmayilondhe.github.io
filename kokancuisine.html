                <h2><u>Kombdi Vade</u></h2>
               <p>
                Kombdi vade is a dish native to the Konkan region in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The dish consists of a traditional chicken curry (including chicken pieces with bones), vade (fluffy fried dumplings made of rice flour, and occasionally of wheat and Ragi flour), onions, lemon juice and solkadhi (a gravy made from coconut milk). This dish is majorly prepared on "Gatari" "Gauri Ovase", "Dev Diwali" and "Shimga" in Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts of Konkan. Generally this dish is available throughout the year especially in the coastal area of Maharashtra including Mumbai

                <h2><u>Sol kadhi</u></h2>
                <p> One of the most popular drinks to come out of the Konkan belt, sol kadhi is a mildly spicy drink made with kokum and coconut milk. A glass is consumed at the end of a meal as it is considered to be a digestive. You will come across several versions if you travel along the Konkan coast. Sometimes, it may have garlic, coriander leaves and cumin. In Goa, some eateries serve it without the coconut milk. This watery version is a kokum-steeped water (like an infusion) with chopped coriander and cumin

                <h2> <u> Bombil Fry</u> </h2>
                <p>Bombil fry, or what is more popularly known as Bombay Duck, is a popular dish available in parts of Konkan, like Maharashtra. In Mumbai, you will find many bars and pubs serving this is a side dish to go with your drinks. Not to be confused with anything from a bird species, Bombay duck is a variety of fish consumed either fresh or in dried form. It is marinated in a combination of spices and fried (sometimes with a coating of rava) and served with lemon wedges.

                        You cannot talk about kadamb without mentioning kolombo. This Konkani sambar is not very different from a typical sambar in a Tamil household. The spices and the preparation methods are pretty much the same, the only difference being that the Konkani variation is loaded with vegetables.
