                <p>Notably Maharashtra's oldest and largest National Park, the "Tadoba National Park", also known as the "Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve" is one of India's 47 project tiger reserves existing in India. It lies in the Chandrapur district of Maharashtra state and is approximately 150 km from Nagpur city. The total area of the tiger reserve is 1,727 Sq.km, which includes the Tadoba National Park, created in the year 1955. The Andhari Wildlife Sanctuary was formed in the year 1986 and was amalgamated with the park in 1995 to establish the present Tadoba Andheri Tiger Reserve. The word 'Tadoba' is derived from the name of God "Tadoba" or "Taru," which is praised by local tribal people of this region and "Andhari" is derived from the name of Andhari river that flows in this area. According to the 2010 National Census on Tigers, there are about 43 tigers in the reserve, which is one of the highest in India. Here are some highlights of the park…

                <p>It is difficult to find out how much ancient this shrine is but from relics it is definitely known that it is very ancient. The Archeological Department of the Government of India declared this shrine as a protected monument.

The Governor if Madhya Pradesh at that time Sri Frank Sly having been impressed by the sight of Sri Kesaria Babu donated 142 acres of land for the shrine on behalf of the Government to the Jain community with all entitlements.<p>There are many idols here which are ancient and discovered from under the ground. The relics found from the ruins are worth seeing fro the art displayed in them.</p>
                
                <p> In upper portion of the temple there is installed a quadruple idol with faces in four directions. This is a very ancient idol which reflects there different Tirthankars viz, Sri Parshva Prabhu, Sri Chandra Prabhu and Sri Adhinath Prabhu and this is its unique feature.

                <p>The Vijasan Caves are a series of caves containing Buddhist art[1] located near the village of Vijasan in Chandrapur district, Maharashtra, India. Some of the caves at Vijasan have been in use since the 1st century AD. The closest nearby city is Bhadravati. The oldest sites around Vijasan date to the 1st century AD, during the reign of Yajna Sri Satakarni of the Satavahana dynasty.[2] Like similar megalithic caves, the caves at Vijasan were cut into stone foothills with intentionally narrow tunnels to prevent collapse.[3] The main cave at Vijasan extends 71 ft (~21 meters) into the rock in a straight line, ending in a chamber with a carved Buddha.[1] The tunnel also contains galleries furnished with wall carvings of religious scenes, though some of these have been damaged. Other, smaller caves and archaeological sites are also present in the area around Vijasan.[1]
                    By the 19th century, the caves were being used to shelter the village's cattle. The caves were visited by British general Alexander Cunningham, who mentioned them in one of his books.[2] The largest cave has been designated a Monument of National Importance by the Archaeological Survey of India.[2]

This enchanting temple is very popular among the pilgrims and history lovers.
                    
                    Shivratri festival is celebrated with great devotion and enthusiasm here. Locals and few tousists come to capture the environment in their cameras. Since this place is not as popular as the other places in Chandrapur, not many outsiders come to visit the temple

                <h5>Timing:ANY TIME</h5>
                <h5>Entry fee:NONE</h5>
                <h5>Location:CHANDRAPUR, MAHRASHTRA</h5>
               <p>The Ballalpur Fort, a ruined architecture in the Ballalpur town is one of the famous tourist attractions in the vicinity of Chandrapur in the state of Maharashtra. It is 16 kms southeast of Chandrapur. Ballalpur is recently being recognize for the coal mines and paper mills it possesses, making the Ballalpur fort prone to tourists and visitors. The building, however ruined is still majestic to look at, in the middle of the woods and the wild.

                The Ballalpur Fort was built by the Good King Khandakya Ballalshah, who ruled over the place with Ballalpur as the capital city. He is known to establish Chandrapur as well which is one of the famous districts of Maharashtra, known for many tourist attractions. He built the fort on the Eastern bank of the Warda river that flows through the area. The Ballalpur fort was built during 1437-62 AD. The fort, in the shape of a large square is built inside walls and bastions. Most of the buildings which stood tall once are now completely in ruins. However the walls on the outside still stand tall and royal in all their glory. The gates are also intact and they are sat at right angles to each other. On the side of the Warda river exists another small gate.
                
                The fort is one of the three famous forts located in the district of Chandrapur: the Ballalpur fort, the Chandrapur fort and the Manikgarh fort). All of these forts are of tribal origin. The Ballalpur fort, besides it's historical value also holds a certain tourist place value. With the ruins it's set in, the wilderness of the area and the rawness of the whole place, it invites an adventurer right inside. It is a place to visit, admire and bask in.

                <h3>Chandrapur Fort</h3>
                <h5>Timing:7AM TO 8PM</h5>
                <h5>Entry fee:NONE</h5>
                <h5>Location:CHANDRAPUR</h5>
                <p>Chandrapur Fort is located within the city limits of Chandrapur. The city gets its name from the fort, which was earlier called Chanda fort and was later renamed as Chandrapur fort. The word 'Chandra' means 'moon' and 'pur' means 'settlement'. The fort was built by the noble king Khandakya Ballal shah during the 13th century.

                    Chandrapur was ruled by various people before the 12th century after which the Adivasi (indigenous) people (also known as Gond rulers) in India took over the land. The Chandrapur fort is situated in the confluence of Irai and Jharpat rivers, it is no doubt a colossal structure which stretches along the length and breadth of Chandrapur city. The fort has huge walls with small openings at the top, there are four gates through which one can enter this fort they are Jatpura Gate in the north, Acalesvar Gate in the east, Binba Gate in the west and Pathanpura Gate in the south.
                    
                    The Pathanpura gate is the main gate of the fort, it has beautiful bold arches with carvings on either side of the gate, there are few windows such as Vithoba khidki and Chor khidki. The whole structure reflects the rich Indian architecture, it also symbolises the inviolability of Chandrapur. The fort was occupied by the Marathas after the death of the Gond king. The Maratha's ruled for quite some time after which the fort was annexed by the British, during the pre-independence the fort was vandalised and the actual buildings that were constructed within the fort were taken down leaving the fort walls and gates. After the independence, no major refurbishment took place, which resulted in the exploitation of the fort by the people and was in a bad state. Looking at this wonderful historical structure deteriorating few people grouped together voluntarily helped cleaning the fort up to 6 km and pledged to clean the rest and restore this masterpiece.
                    
                    As the fort is within the city, you can find many buildings being constructed adjacent the fort, some of the main roads also pass through it. The moment you step into the city you will find various sections of the fort like a jig-saw puzzle where some parts are lost permanently, and others are in desperate need of renovation. The fort can be visited throughout the year rain or shine. There are no fixed visiting hours; however, it is preferred to visit the fort during timings 7:00 AM - 8:00 PM and the entry here is free, the exploration time is one hour. Make sure to carry enough water and wear comfortable clothes also take a hat or an umbrella as the place is quite hot. A pair of binoculars would be great for sightseeing.
